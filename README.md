# Cable-Map-Stat

Greg's Cable Map (http://www.cablemap.info/) is an attempt to consolidate all the available information about the undersea communications infrastructure. The initial data was harvested from Wikipedia, and further information was gathered by simply googling and transcribing as much data as possible into a useful format, namely a rich geocoded format.

This project mainly focus on the statistical metrics for different countries, including the country's current bandwidth (Gbps), the addtional bandwidth (Gbps) that will be available in the near future, the number of cables without capacity among the cables that are already working, the number of the cables without capacity that will be turned on in the future, etc.
